RandomPeripherals
=================
Random Peripherals is an Mod for Minecraft (and an extension for the computercraft mod) which adds at the moment only a few blocks. It's a collection(of two things) of things just what I needed.

Credits: 
Of course the Mojang, MCP and Forge guys without them nothing like that were possible, dan200 for the computercraft one of my favorite mods and TeamCofh for their great API and references like minefactory reloaded

And yes, I toke some code from CofhCore(the IconRegister completely the side configuration tab almost completely and the power configuration tab is based on the redstone controll tab)
